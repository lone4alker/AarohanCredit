      "behavioral_score_justification": "The overall behavioral score reflects a generally healthy and stable financial profile. Strong positive indicators include consistent positive net cash flow, high cash flow stability, regular transaction patterns, and effective management of seasonality. The primary areas for caution are the detected 'rapid_balance_change' anomalies, which warrant monitoring, and the unquantified concentration risk due to limited data. No critical red flags were identified.",
      "repayment_pattern_score_justification": "The high cashflow stability score (0.888), substantial positive net cashflow (442,711.0), and consistent regular credits and debits indicate a strong capacity for timely repayments. The average balance is healthy, suggesting good liquidity management. While 'rapid_balance_change' anomalies are present, they are noted as 'medium' severity and, in the context of overall positive cash flow and healthy average balance, likely represent normal business fluctuations (e.g., large payments received/made) rather than distress. The absence of detected EMI payments is neutral; if the MSME has existing debt, this would be a concern, but without that context, it doesn't detract from the observed cash flow health.",
      "concentration_risk_score_justification": "The provided data lacks explicit details on the diversity of income sources (e.g., number of key clients, percentage of revenue from top clients). The 'inflow_count' of 50 over a year (approximately 4-5 per month) is not exceptionally high, which could imply some reliance on a limited number of larger transactions or clients. Without further information to confirm diversification, a moderate score is assigned, reflecting a potential but unquantified concentration risk.",
      "cyclicality_score_justification": "Seasonality is explicitly detected ('seasonality_detected: true') and confirmed by the monthly breakdown of credits and debits. However, the high 'cashflow_stability_score' (0.888) despite this seasonality is a strong positive indicator. It suggests that the MSME effectively manages its cash flow through seasonal peaks and troughs, demonstrating resilience and good financial planning in response to its business cycle.",
      "risk_level_justification": "The overall financial health is robust, characterized by strong cash flow stability and positive net cash flow. While there are 'medium' severity rapid balance change anomalies and an unquantified concentration risk, these are not severe enough to elevate the risk to 'high' given the strong underlying performance. The business demonstrates good operational cash flow management."

This is supported by consistent positive net cash flow, high cash flow stability, regular transaction patterns, and effective management of seasonal business fluctuations. While some rapid balance changes were noted, they are considered medium severity and do not significantly detract from your overall strong financial behavior. No critical red flags were identified.",
      "repayment_pattern_score": "A high repayment pattern score of 90 reflects your strong capacity for timely repayments. This is evidenced by your high cash flow stability (0.888), substantial positive net cash flow (\u20b9442,711.0), and consistent regular credits and debits. Your healthy average balance suggests good liquidity management. The rapid balance changes are likely normal business fluctuations rather than signs of distress, given your overall positive cash flow.",
      "concentration_risk_score": "Your concentration risk score of 65 is moderate. This is because the provided data doesn't offer explicit details on the diversity of your income sources, such as the number of key clients or the percentage of revenue from top clients. With approximately 4-5 inflows per month, there's a potential, though unquantified, reliance on a limited number of larger transactions or clients. Further information on client diversification would help refine this assessment.",
      "cyclicality_score": "Your cyclicality score of 80 indicates that while seasonality is detected in your business operations, you manage it effectively. The high cash flow stability score (0.888) despite seasonal peaks and troughs demonstrates resilience and good financial planning. This suggests your business is well-adapted to its natural cycles.",
      "risk_level": "Your overall risk level is assessed as 'medium'. This is primarily due to the strong underlying financial health, characterized by robust cash flow stability and positive net cash flow.

      "**Implement Detailed Cash Flow Forecasting:** Develop a weekly or bi-weekly cash flow forecast to anticipate periods of low balance, especially around seasonal dips (e.g., May-June, November) and plan for major outflows or inventory purchases. This will help reduce the 28 'low balance days'.",
      "**Optimize Inventory Management:** As an FMCG retailer, efficient inventory turnover is critical. Analyze sales data to identify slow-moving stock and optimize purchasing to prevent capital blockage. Implement a 'just-in-time' approach where feasible.",
      "**Accelerate B2B Receivables:** Given that 69.3% of sales are B2B, establish clear credit terms and a robust follow-up system for collections. Consider offering small early payment discounts to encourage prompt payments from business clients.",
      "**Negotiate Favorable Supplier Terms:** Explore opportunities to extend payment terms with key suppliers without incurring penalties, thereby retaining cash within the business for longer periods.",
      "**Establish a Liquidity Buffer:** Aim to maintain a minimum operating balance equivalent to 1-2 months of critical operating expenses. This buffer will help absorb rapid balance changes and prevent the balance from dropping to critically low levels (e.g., 2180.0).",
      "**Strategic Use of Working Capital:** Utilize the recommended Quick Working Capital Loan to bridge temporary cash flow gaps, manage seasonal inventory build-up, and ensure consistent liquidity without stressing existing cash reserves."

      "**Maintain Healthy Bank Balances Consistently:** Actively work to reduce the number of 'low balance days' (currently 28). Lenders prefer to see consistent, healthy liquidity rather than frequent dips, even if the average balance is good.",
      "**Monitor Business Credit Report:** Regularly obtain and review the business's CIBIL or Experian credit report for accuracy. Dispute any discrepancies promptly to ensure a clean credit profile.",
      "**Ensure All Business Transactions Through Business Account:** Continue to channel all business-related inflows and outflows through the registered business bank account to provide a clear, auditable financial trail for lenders.",

      "**Establish a Contingency Fund:** Beyond the liquidity buffer, create a separate contingency fund for unforeseen events, major equipment breakdowns, or significant market downturns.",
      "**Analyze Rapid Balance Change Anomalies:** Investigate the root causes of the detected 'rapid_balance_change' anomalies. If they are due to large, infrequent payments, ensure these are predictable. If they indicate erratic cash flow, address the underlying operational issues.",
      "**Secure Adequate Business Insurance:** Ensure comprehensive insurance coverage for inventory, property, and business interruptions, which is crucial for a retail business, especially one dealing with FMCG.",
      "**Formalize B2B Credit Policies:** Develop and strictly adhere to formal credit policies for B2B clients, including credit limits, payment terms, and collection procedures, to minimize bad debt risk."
