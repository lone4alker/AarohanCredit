      "justification": {
        "repayment_pattern_score": "The business demonstrates strong repayment behavior. This is supported by an exceptionally high cashflow stability score (0.94), consistent positive net cashflow (1.55M over the period), regular credit and debit patterns, and the detection of 8 EMI payments. While 5 instances of 'medium' severity rapid balance changes were observed, the overall high cashflow stability suggests these fluctuations are effectively managed and do not significantly impair the business's ability to meet its obligations. The minimum balance of 35,000, though low, is not zero and is balanced by a healthy average balance.",
        "concentration_risk_score": "A moderate concentration risk is identified. The inflow count of 36 over a full year (averaging approximately 3 inflows per month) combined with a high average inflow amount (~176k) suggests that the business may rely on a relatively small number of larger transactions or key clients. This implies that the loss of one or two major income sources could have a notable impact. However, the 'regular_credits: true' indicator suggests consistency in the timing of these inflows, which slightly mitigates the risk.",
        "cyclicality_score": "Seasonality is explicitly detected, and the 'High balance volatility' stress indicator, along with a calculated balance standard deviation of 422,329.87 against an average balance of 627,303.05, confirms significant fluctuations in the account balance throughout the year. The monthly breakdown of credits shows variations (e.g., a ~20% swing between May and July). Despite these cyclical patterns and balance swings, the overall high cashflow stability score (0.94) suggests that the business effectively manages these periods. The low 'volatility_score' (0.06) likely refers to a different aspect of volatility (e.g., day-to-day transaction level) rather than the overall balance trend. The presence of seasonality and its impact on balance still represents a moderate risk, requiring prudent cash flow management.",
        "behavioral_score": "This composite score reflects a generally strong behavioral profile. The business exhibits excellent cash flow stability and disciplined repayment behavior. The primary areas of concern are moderate concentration risk due to fewer, larger inflows and the management of seasonality-driven balance volatility. However, the high cashflow stability suggests these inherent business characteristics are being managed effectively, leading to a favorable overall behavioral score.",
        "risk_level": "The overall behavioral credit risk is assessed as 'low'. This is primarily driven by the excellent cashflow stability, consistent positive net cashflow, detected EMI payments, and the absence of any critical red flags. While there are identified anomalies (rapid balance changes) and moderate risks related to income concentration and seasonality, these are not severe enough to elevate the risk to 'medium', particularly given the strong evidence of effective cash flow management."

The average balance is healthy at \u20b9627,303.06, indicating good liquidity management. However, there is detected seasonality and high balance volatility, meaning cash flow and balances fluctuate throughout the year. The cashflow stability score of 0.94 is excellent, suggesting the business effectively manages these fluctuations.",
      "behavioral_score": "With a behavioral score of 730 out of 1000, the business demonstrates a generally strong and reliable profile. This score reflects excellent cash flow stability and disciplined repayment behavior, despite some inherent business characteristics like seasonality and moderate income concentration.",
      "repayment_pattern_score": "An exceptionally high repayment pattern score of 85 indicates strong and consistent repayment behavior. This is supported by a high cashflow stability score, regular credit and debit patterns, and the detection of 8 EMI payments, showing reliability in meeting financial obligations.",
      "concentration_risk_score": "A moderate concentration risk score of 60 suggests that the business might rely on a relatively small number of larger transactions or key clients for its inflows. While regular, the limited number of inflows (36 over a year) means that the loss of one or two major income sources could have a noticeable impact.",
      "cyclicality_score": "A cyclicality score of 70 reflects the detected seasonality and high balance volatility. The account balance fluctuates significantly throughout the year, as evidenced by a balance standard deviation of \u20b9422,329.87. Despite these patterns, the high cashflow stability score indicates effective management of these cyclical periods.",
      "risk_level": "The overall behavioral credit risk is assessed as 'low'. This favorable assessment is primarily due to excellent cashflow stability, consistent positive net cashflow, and the absence of critical red flags. While moderate risks related to income concentration and seasonality exist, they are managed effectively, preventing an elevation to a higher risk level.",
      "cashflow_stability_score": "An outstanding cashflow stability score of 0.94 signifies that the business maintains highly predictable and consistent cash flow patterns. This is a crucial indicator of financial health and the ability to meet ongoing obligations, even in the face of detected seasonality and balance volatility.",
      "volatility_score": "The low volatility score of 0.06 suggests that, at a day-to-day transaction level, the cash flow is relatively stable. This contrasts with the 'High balance volatility' stress indicator, which refers to larger, periodic swings in the overall account balance, often linked to seasonality."

      "**Improve Accounts Receivable (AR) Management:** Shorten payment terms for new clients, offer small discounts for early payments (e.g., 1-2% for payment within 7 days), and establish a systematic follow-up process for overdue invoices. Given the 79.2% B2B sales ratio, efficient AR is critical.",
      "**Negotiate Extended Supplier Payment Terms:** Where possible, negotiate longer payment cycles with key suppliers without incurring penalties, especially for non-critical raw materials or services, to retain cash longer within the business.",
      "**Establish a Dedicated Cash Reserve:** Aim to build a cash reserve equivalent to at least 1-2 months of average operational outflows (approx. \u20b9400,000 - \u20b9800,000) to act as a buffer against seasonal dips and unexpected expenses, significantly increasing the minimum balance from the current \u20b935,000.",
      "**Implement Detailed Cash Flow Forecasting:** Develop a monthly and quarterly cash flow forecast that accounts for detected seasonality, projecting inflows and outflows to anticipate liquidity needs and plan for financing proactively.",
      "**Explore Invoice Financing:** Actively utilize invoice financing (as recommended) to unlock capital tied up in outstanding B2B invoices, improving immediate liquidity and bridging cash flow gaps, especially during periods of high outflow or delayed customer payments."

      "**Responsible Credit Utilization:** Utilize the recommended working capital loan or invoice financing judiciously. Ensure all repayments are made on time or even slightly ahead of schedule to build a robust credit history with formal lenders.",
      "**Diversify Credit Relationships:** Over time, consider taking small, short-term credit facilities from different lenders (e.g., a small equipment loan, a line of credit) and repaying them diligently. This broadens the credit footprint and demonstrates creditworthiness across multiple institutions.",

      "**Robust Inventory Management:** Implement advanced inventory management systems to optimize stock levels. This avoids tying up excessive capital in inventory (overstocking) and prevents lost sales due to stockouts (understocking), both of which impact cash flow.",
