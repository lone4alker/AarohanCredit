    "metadata": {
      "behavioral_score_justification": "The overall behavioral score reflects a business with strong positive net cashflow and a high cashflow stability score (0.8887), indicating generally sound financial health. However, these positives are significantly tempered by several concerning factors: 'High balance volatility' is explicitly flagged as a stress indicator, the minimum balance of 2180.0 is critically low relative to the average balance, suggesting potential liquidity crunches. Furthermore, five instances of 'rapid balance change' anomalies (ranging from 71.8% to 218.8%) indicate unpredictable and significant fluctuations in funds, which can pose operational and repayment risks. Seasonality, while not inherently negative, adds a layer of complexity to cash flow management.",
      "repayment_pattern_score_justification": "The repayment pattern score is moderately good, primarily due to the detection of 'regular debits' and a high 'cashflow_stability_score'. These suggest a predictable pattern of outflows, which is favorable for managing repayments. However, the absence of detected EMI payments means there's no direct evidence of past loan repayment behavior. The very low minimum balance and the 'rapid balance change' anomalies raise concerns about the business's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet obligations consistently, especially if these anomalies represent unplanned large outflows.",
      "concentration_risk_score_justification": "The concentration risk score is good, indicating a moderate level of diversification. With 50 inflows and 69 outflows over the period, and transactions categorized across 'operational', 'tax', and 'investment', the business does not appear to be overly reliant on a single source of income or a single type of expenditure. While granular details on specific counterparties are not available, the volume and categorization of transactions suggest a healthy spread for an MSME. No explicit red flags for concentration risk were identified.",
      "cyclicality_score_justification": "The cyclicality score is in the moderate range due to the explicit detection of 'seasonality'. The monthly breakdown of credits and debits clearly shows fluctuations, with a peak in Q3 (July-September) and a dip in Q4 (November). While seasonality is a natural characteristic for many businesses, it introduces inherent cash flow management challenges. The 'High balance volatility' stress indicator and the critically low minimum balance could be exacerbated by these seasonal swings, indicating that the business might face difficulties in managing liquidity during leaner periods if not adequately prepared.",
      "risk_level_justification": "The risk level is assessed as 'medium'. While the business demonstrates strong positive net cashflow and high cashflow stability, which are significant strengths, the presence of 'High balance volatility', a critically low minimum balance, and multiple 'rapid balance change' anomalies point to underlying liquidity management challenges and operational unpredictability. The detected seasonality further contributes to this risk, requiring robust financial planning to navigate lean periods. These factors collectively elevate the risk from low to medium, as they suggest potential vulnerabilities despite overall positive performance."
