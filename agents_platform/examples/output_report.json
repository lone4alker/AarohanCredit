        "behavioral_score": "The overall behavioral score of 710 reflects a strong financial capacity and good repayment discipline, but with notable behavioral risks. Positives include a very high net cashflow (722,000), good cashflow stability (0.71), and 6 detected EMI payments. However, significant deductions were made due to high balance volatility (stress indicator), seasonality coupled with volatility, and three instances of rapid balance changes, which indicate lumpy and less predictable cash flow patterns.",
        "repayment_pattern_score": "Scored 90/100. This high score is justified by the detection of 6 EMI payments, which is a strong indicator of consistent repayment behavior and discipline. Furthermore, the very high net cashflow (722,000) and good cashflow stability (0.71) demonstrate ample capacity to meet obligations.",
        "concentration_risk_score": "Scored 50/100. This score indicates moderate concentration risk. With only 6 inflow transactions over approximately 3.5 months, and a high average inflow of 161,666, the business appears to rely on a few larger transactions rather than a highly diversified stream of smaller ones. The 'rapid_balance_change' anomalies further support the presence of significant, lumpy inflows.",
        "cyclicality_score": "Scored 40/100. While seasonality is explicitly detected, it is accompanied by a relatively high volatility score (0.349) and identified as a 'High balance volatility' stress indicator. This suggests that while patterns exist, the associated fluctuations are significant and could lead to periods of cash flow stress, making the cyclicality a risk factor rather than a predictable, manageable pattern.",
        "risk_level": "Assessed as 'medium'. The business exhibits strong financial fundamentals (high net cashflow, good stability, proven EMI payments) which are positive. However, the high balance volatility, rapid balance changes, and the nature of the detected seasonality introduce an element of unpredictability and potential stress, warranting a medium risk classification. The business has the capacity, but its cash flow behavior requires closer monitoring.",
        "red_flags": "The 'High balance volatility' identified in the financial health snapshot's stress indicators is a significant red flag, indicating potential instability in the business's cash reserves.",
        "anomalies": "Three instances of 'rapid_balance_change' were detected, indicating significant, sudden shifts in the balance. These are important to note as they contribute to the overall volatility and could represent irregular large transactions or events that impact cash flow predictability."
